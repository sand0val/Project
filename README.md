# Project
MECE 5397 Poisson Equation Project
The following repository is for Johnathan's Computing for Mechanical Engineers project. 

The Poisson .m file in the main folder is the original code that was produced for the purpose of this project. The code has been left there as an example of when this was started and also for some insight in the progression of this project. 

The following folders contain the the following included material

-project/doc/    (Contains the final report due for this course and some plots/data from testing)

-project/src/    (Contains the final working versions of my Poisson code)

-project/bin/    (Contains any executables I planned on including which is none)

-project/test/   (Contains all my test files before I had a succesfully running code, so there is many prototype files in this folder that                   illustrate my progress as the project went on)


Please refer to file "PoissonFinal" inside the project/src folder for the final working version.
