# Project
MECE 5397 Poisson Equation Project
The following repository is for Johnathan's Computing for Mechanical Engineers project. 

The Poisson .m file in the main folder is the original code that was produced for the purpose of this project. The code has been left there as an example of when this was started and also for some insight in the progression of this project.
